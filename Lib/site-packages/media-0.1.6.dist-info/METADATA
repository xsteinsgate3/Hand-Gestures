## Quick Start
### Get the keys
> See "[Get the keys for your resource - Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account?tabs=multiservice%2Cwindows#get-the-keys-for-your-resource)"

### Text-to-speech
```python
from media import Voice

text = "One Piece! Dragon Ball! Doraemon! Naruto!"
voice = Voice("YourSubscriptionKey", "YourServiceRegion")
# use English
voice.speak(text)
# use Japanese
voice.speak(text, lang=Voice.LANG.JA_JP, voice_name=Voice.NAME.FEMALE.JA_JP_NANAMI)
# Save the voice file to the local
voice.save(text)
```

### Use phonemes to improve pronunciation
```python
from media import Voice, SSML

voice = Voice("YourSubscriptionKey", "YourServiceRegion")
ssml = SSML()
# If you want to modify the phoneme of a word, add '[]' in text
ssml.voice = {
    "text": "His name is Mike [Zhou]",
    "phonemes": [{
        "word": "Zhou",
        "alphabet": "ups",  # default: sapi
        "ph": "JH AU",
    }]
}
voice.speak(ssml)
```
> The values ​​of `alphabet` and `ph` can refer to here, see: "[Use phonemes to improve pronunciation - Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-synthesis-markup?tabs=csharp#use-phonemes-to-improve-pronunciation)"

### Error detection
```python
success = voice.speak()
if not success:
    # do something...
    print(voice.error)
    # do something...
```

### View the generated XML for SSML
```python
from media import SSML

ssml = SSML()
# for human
print(ssml)
# for program
ssml.dump()
```

## Full Example
Text-to-speech, in a different tone.
```python
from media import Voice, SSML

voice = Voice("YourSubscriptionKey", "YourServiceRegion")
ssml = SSML(lang=SSML.LANG.ZH_CN, voice_name=SSML.NAME.FEMALE.ZH_CN_XIAO_XUAN)
ssml.voice = "啊？"
ssml.voice = {
    "text": "这是可以说的吗？",
    "role": SSML.ROLE.YOUNG_ADULT_FEMALE,
    "style": SSML.STYLE.CHEERFUL,
    "rate": SSML.RATE.MEDIUM,
}
ssml.voice = {
    "text": "啊，可以可以",
    "name": SSML.NAME.FEMALE.ZH_CN_XIAO_MO,
    "style": SSML.STYLE.FEARFUL,

    "degree": "2",
    "rate": SSML.RATE.FAST,
}
# It will play the generated speech
